<h1>Can Duruk</h1>

<div class="box">
  <p>Founder at <a href="https://felt.com">Felt</a>.
  <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://uber.com">Uber</a> and a few other places.</p>
  <p>
    On rare occasions when I'm not running (either my company, or on the streets of San Francisco), I write stuff like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/opinion/instagram-facebook.html">this</a> or <a href="https://www.readmargins.com">that</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
     ps: I am <a href="https://felt.com/careers">hiring</a>! We have a big mission, employee-friendly terms, and a great culture.
